# E-commerce-winter
## Project Background
In this challenge, you will take on the role of a data analyst exploring a complete festive season retail dataset. The company operates sales across Web, Stores, and Marketplaces and runs a series of Christmas and holiday marketing campaigns from Black Friday through New Year.
<br> <br>
The dataset captures everything that happens during this period: promotions, customer orders, deliveries, inventory levels, and returns. Your mission is to uncover insights that help improve holiday campaign performance, customer experience, and operational efficiency.

## Main Goal
